                        term generally describes a type of footwear with a flexible sole made
                        of rubber or synthetic material and an upper part made of leather or
                        synthetic materials.

                    <h5 class="productDescription">Sandals are an open type of shoe, consisting
                        of a sole held to the wearer's foot by straps going over the instep and,
                        sometimes, around the ankle. Sandals can also have a heel. While the distinction
                        between sandals and other types of footwear can sometimes be blurry (as in the
                        case of huarachesâ€”the woven leather footwear seen in Mexico, and peep-toe pumps),
                        the common understanding is that a sandal leaves all or most of the foot exposed.
                        People may choose to wear sandals for several reasons, among them comfort in warm
                        weather, economy (sandals tend to require less material than shoes and are usually
                        easier to construct), and as a fashion choice.

                    <h5 class="productDescription">High heels are a type of shoe in which the heel,
                        compared to the toe, is significantly higher off of the ground. These shoes go
                        beyond simply protecting the foot from the ground or improve efficiency of walking.
                        High heels make the wearer taller, accentuating the calf muscle and the length of
                        the leg overall.[1] There are many types of high heels, which come in different
                        styles, colors, and materials, and can be found all over the world. They have
                        significant cultural and fashionable meanings attached to them, which have been
                        largely shaped by historical contexts over the past 1000 years.

                        Flat shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot
                        while the wearer is doing various activities. Shoes are also used as an item
                        of decoration and fashion. The design of shoes has varied enormously through
                        time and from culture to culture, with appearance originally being tied to function.
